## Requirements - Final development

- [x] Name and logo for the fictional store. 
- [x] Class diagram containing the general structure of the project.
- [x] The entity and relationship diagram for the database.
- [x] Functional user authentication modules (Login and password) and customer registration.
- [ ] Aggregate database that performs basic CRUD operations (CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE).
- [ ] Product registration, product catalog and product sale screens.
- [ ] Authentication and user registration saving the data in the database.

```
We had several problems in the implementation of the database, as it was an opinion for the current delivery, unfortunately we do not provide this requirement. We continue to research and try to solve these problems.

## About the project

We chose this name for a fun fact, <b>"LHMA"</b> is the initial of the name of each member of our group, and coincidentally the junction almost forms the word <b>"LHAMA"</b>, so it makes sense with our pet shop proposal and we use a llama as a mascot and logo of our application.
Our project consists in a client registration application and login of a pet shop, there are interesting but basic features to use, an example is the user authentication to login, right after the registration.

## Steps by steps

* First of all you need to install the Java environment on your desktop [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/br/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) and [Java](https://www.java.com/pt-BR/);
* Now download the [.jar](https://github.com/LHMA-Pet-Shop/AC2/tree/main/dist) file available on our GitHub with the contents that the application need to run with no trouble;
* Run it and explore the application by yourself, there are some features at the actual moment like the register of the user and the authentication of it;
* If you see any "bug" or an suggestion, please send us an email and tell to us: bikoltda@outlook.com.
